    !TODO insert layout photos

    Identifiy modules

    Agree on bicycle object definition

    
        Roland: look into rather setting up virtual enviroments for version control
            - everyone has different versions of python
            - clash of package versions, eg f strings
            - 2 linux, two mac
        https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtualenv/
            Everyone uses this
        DROP THIS FOR NOW.
        End users will also have different versions

Test own branches

.gitignore:
    .ipynb

    (from Roland)


# GROUP CHECK: all have updated .gitignore. DONE

Group session: intialise bike object.
    - coordinates in space
    - discuss array structure
    - rows: x, y
    - columns: bike components
    - initialise bike array as python object (import bike!)
     from bike import *
    DONE

Tasks:
    settled on two groups of two for SIM and GA.
        - viz: can re-use animation code from earlier in the week
        - if we don't manage: plot static output as MINIMAL OUTPUT
    drew lots for SIM, GA
        SIM: Roland, Turkuler
        GA: Pat, Elsa

Will work on tasks in two groups tomorrow.
Discuss again halfway through working time tomorrow for updates, etc.

//end day one


//two
go through bike obj pull request
merged & confirmed DONE.

PLAN: work in pairs defined yesterday.

Meet again at coffee - any changes to bike object needed?
